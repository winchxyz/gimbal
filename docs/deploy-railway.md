# Running the engine on Railway

The engine (`serve`) has to run without a break while a pair is open: it holds the pair, rescues a leg near
liquidation and, with `strategy.auto`, enters, exits and rotates. A laptop that sleeps or restarts for an update
leaves the pair unguarded, so the engine runs as one container on Railway. `Dockerfile` and `railway.json` at the
repo root are all it needs.

## What runs where

- **One service, one replica, one volume.** Railway never runs two deployments of a service with a volume at the
  same time, and a service with a volume cannot have replicas. That matters: two engines on one desk would send
  every order twice. The per-desk trader lock is a file, so it only stops a second engine on the same disk.
  **While the Railway engine runs, run nothing that trades this desk anywhere else**: no local `serve` with
  `GIMBAL_TRADE=1`, no `pair-mainnet --send`, no `fund.mjs --send`. Read-only commands are fine.
- **The volume is mounted on `/data`.** The image sets `XDG_STATE_HOME=/data` and `GIMBAL_STATE_DIR=/data/gimbal`:
  the trader state (the legs' baselines the ADL watch compares against), the confirmed engine rules
  (`PUT /strategy`), the strategy loop's counters and the locks all live there and survive a redeploy.
- **Region: EU West (Amsterdam).** Hyperliquid refuses US IP addresses.
- **Shutdown: `drainingSeconds` 180.** On SIGTERM serve starts nothing new and waits up to 180 s for an order, a
  close or a rescue already under way. Railway's default is 0 s, which would kill it mid-order.
- **No public port.** The engine's HTTP API listens on `127.0.0.1:8790` only and has no login: anyone who could
  reach it could close the pair or turn `auto` on. Do not add a public domain to the service. Reach it from
  inside the container with `railway ssh` (below).

## Set up

1. New project → Deploy from GitHub repo (or `railway up` from a clean checkout). Railway reads `railway.json`
   and builds the `Dockerfile`.
2. Settings → Region: EU West. Settings → Networking: no public domain.
3. Add a volume to the service, mount path `/data`.
4. Variables (Raw Editor accepts a pasted env file). The names, values never in the repo:
   - from `.keys/engine-mainnet-<contract>.env` (written by `tools/mainnet/desk.mjs`): `GIMBAL_MODE`,
     `NEAR_NETWORK`, `GIMBAL_CONTRACT_ID`, `DESK_ID`, `OWNER_ACCOUNT_ID`, `OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_ID`,
     `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OPERATOR_ALLOWANCE_NEAR`, `ORDERLY_BROKER_ID`, `HL_API_URL`, `ORDERLY_API_URL`,
     `PHOENIX_API_URL`, `SOLANA_RPC_URL`;
   - `ONECLICK_API_KEY` (rescues and transfers), `NEAR_AI_API_KEY` (the veto; without it windows pass with
     "no veto check");
   - `GIMBAL_TRADE=1`, `GIMBAL_RESCUE=1`;
   - `GIMBAL_TRADER_FRESH=<contract>/<desk>` for the first start only when a pair is already open and its legs
     were checked on the venues (`docs/interfaces.md`, "The pair in serve"); remove it after that start.
5. Deploy. The log shows the start lines: mode, contract, which legs are live, which protections trade, the
   rescue routes, and `strategy: off` until the owner turns `auto` on.

## Operate

```
railway ssh                                   # a shell in the running container
node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8790/state').then(r=>r.json()).then(s=>console.log(s.decision, s.desk?.health))"
node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8790/strategy').then(r=>r.json()).then(console.log)"
```

`PUT /strategy` with the same body and `"auto": true` turns the loop on; `POST /close` closes both legs. Both
need `content-type: application/json` and a localhost Host, which a request from inside the container has.

## What the server holds, and what it cannot do

The service holds the engine's **operator key**, not the owner's key. On NEAR it is a FunctionCall access key on
the owner's account:

- it can call only the 21 operator methods of the Gimbal contract (`set_paused`, `fund_venue`, the venue order and
  signing methods, `panic_close`; the list `desk.mjs` prints when it adds the key), and nothing on any other
  contract;
- `withdraw_to_owner`, `set_policy`, `create_desk` and resuming a desk the owner paused are not on that list, so
  this key cannot call them;
- it can spend at most its allowance (5 NEAR on the mainnet desk) of the owner's NEAR on gas.

Every transfer the operator can start goes to the desk's own addresses only, and every order is held to the
policy: README "What cannot be stolen" lists each path and the contract check behind it. So a stolen operator key
can burn up to the allowance in gas and trade badly within the policy's caps, but it cannot send the desk's money
anywhere else. The 1Click and NEAR AI keys on the service are API keys for those services; neither can sign for
the desk.
